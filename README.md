WordPress Event Plugin
======================

Please create a simple plugin that registers a custom post (ex. Events), a corresponding category (ex. Event Types), registers a metabox with a couple fields (ex. Start Date and End Date). The plugin should also create a shortcode that can be used to display a listing of all the posts of the created post type.


### Installation Instructions

* Download the zip file into a local folder
* From your WordPress dashboard, visit plugins > Upload Plugin
* You're done!


### Usage Instructions

* Click on the events tab on the left and add new event
* Use the shortcode [list-events]



### Any decisions you made that weren't straightforward

- 


### Any unforeseen issues you encountered

- Creating shortcode buttons on the previous TinyMCE editor used to be straightforward but with the new Gutenburg editor, I had to do some research on how to implement the shortcode buttons on the new editor.


### Any items left unfinished, and/or a wishlist for improvements

- Wishlist: make event category only for events
