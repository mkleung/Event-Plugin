WordPress Event Plugin
======================

Please create a simple plugin that registers a custom post (ex. Events), a corresponding category (ex. Event Types), registers a metabox with a couple fields (ex. Start Date and End Date). The plugin should also create a shortcode that can be used to display a listing of all the posts of the created post type.
